#FAQ

##### What is the ModelSEED?

ModelSEED is a web application for the reconstruction, exploration, comparison, and analysis of metabolic models.  The UI is built primarily on the web service [ModelSEED-Pro](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ProbModelSEED).


##### Which browsers are supported?

We strive to support all evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE10+).  For the best performance, we recommend using <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Chrome</a>.  Please <a href="https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEED-UI/issues">submit an issue</a> or <a href="mailto:nconrad@anl.gov">email</a> us if you encounter any issues.


##### What methods are used for reconstruction, gapfilling, FBA?

Behind the scenes, all methods and algorithms used in the new ModelSEED should produce the same results as the original ModelSEED.  However, you'll notice better performance, more options, and flexibility.  Read more in the paper <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n9/full/nbt.1672.html">here</a>.
